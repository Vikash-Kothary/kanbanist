# Kanbanist 
The missing kanban board for [Todoist](https://todoist.com/).

![Kanbanist](src/pages/kanbanist.png?raw=true "Kanbanist")

## Update 2020-02-27
As of today, the Todoist API prevents users without [Todoist Premium](https://todoist.com/premium) from creating Labels.
Kanbanist uses Labels as the lists so without labels, well, there's not a whole lot going on.

## Features

- Create a dynamic kanban board for Todoist tasks.
- Completely serverless: the application syncs to/from Todoist directly so changes instanstly show up in all your Todoist apps.
- Private and secure: no server means no place for unwanted eyes to look at your tasks.
- Build the perfect board using filters and then save your board as a bookmark.
- Full support for [Todoist quick-add syntax](https://support.todoist.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001745265-Task-Quick-Add).
- Full support for `markdown` and emojis ðŸŽ‰.

## Known Issues

- As described in [Issue 74](https://github.com/mwakerman/kanbanist/issues/74), you cannot scroll the board by dragging a task to the edge as is possible in Trello. This is an issue with the underlying drag-and-drop library: the (otherwise excellent) [`react-beautiful-dnd`](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd).

## Development

Kanbanist is a static (serverless) website built using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and dependencies are managed using [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

To get started `git clone` the repository and then run `yarn` (to install dependencies) and `yarn start` to start the development server.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

		prettier --print-width 120 ---tab-width 4 -single-quote --jsx-bracket-same-line --arrow-parens avoid --trailing-comma es5 --write src/**/*.js
