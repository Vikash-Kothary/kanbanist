## Features
- Create a dynamic kanban board for Todoist tasks.
- Completely serverless: the application syncs to/from Todoist directly so changes instanstly show up in all your Todoist apps.
- Private and secure: no server means no place for unwanted eyes to look at your tasks.
- Build the perfect board using filters and then save your board as a bookmark.
- Full support for [Todoist quick-add syntax](https://support.todoist.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001745265-Task-Quick-Add).
- Full support for `markdown` and emojis ðŸŽ‰.

## Known Issues
- As described in [Issue 9](https://github.com/mwakerman/kanbanist/issues/9), the drag-and-drop functionality is visually buggy (offset) and not working at all in Safari.
