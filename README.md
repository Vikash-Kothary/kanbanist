# Kanbanist 1.0 ‚è§ The missing Kanban board for [Todoist](https://todoist.com/)

## Update: September, 2023

I'm excited to announce the launch of [Kanbanist 2](https://kanban.ist), a ground-up rewrite of Kanbanist, designed to support many of the features requested here, including project columns, dark mode, customizable task cards, task search, and much more. Kanbanist 2 is not open-source (yet), and Kanbanist 1.0 (this project) is still available at https://old.kanban.ist.

## Known Issues

- As described in [Issue 74](https://github.com/mwakerman/kanbanist/issues/74), you cannot scroll the board by dragging a task to the edge as is possible in Trello. This is an issue with the underlying drag-and-drop library [`react-beautiful-dnd`](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd).

## Development

Kanbanist is a static (serverless) website built using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and dependencies are managed using [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

To get started `git clone` the repository and then run `yarn` (to install dependencies) and `yarn start` to start the development server.
